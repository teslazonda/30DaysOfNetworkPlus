# Network Transceivers and Fiber Connectors

## Transceiver
* Transmitter and receiver (usually in a single component).
* Provides a modular interface.
### SFP and SFP+
* Small Form-factor Pluggable (1 Gbits/ fiber).
* Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable (16 Gbits). Common with 10 Gigabit ethernet.

### QSFP
* 4 channel SFP (Four 1 Gbit/s = 4Gbit/s)
* QSFP+ is four-channel SFP+ = 40Gbit/s
* Combine four SFPs in to a single transceiver in data centers.

## Fiber Connectors

### SC - Subscriber Connector
* The "Square connector" or "Standard" connector for fiber.
* Pushes on to lock, pull to unlock.
* A popular fiber connector. Common in most data centers.

### LC - Local Connector
* Smaller than subscriber connector.
* Locks in place with a clip.

### ST - Straight Tip
* Bayonet connector (stick and twist).
* Push on and turn.

### MPO - Multi-fiber Push On
* Twelve fibers in a single connector.
* Push to lock in place.
