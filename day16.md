# Infrastructure as Code

## IaC
* Describe an infrastructure.
  * Define servers, network, and applications as definition files.
* Modify the infrastructure and create versions
  * The same way you version application code.
* Use the description (code) to build other application instances.
  * Build it the same way every time based on the code.

## Playbooks
* Conditional steps to follow, a broad process
  * Investigate a data breach, recover from ransomware.
* Often integrated with a SOAR platform
  * Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response
  * Integrate third-party tools and data sources.

## Automation Use Cases
* Configuration drift/compliance
  * Ensure the same configurations for all systems.
  * The configuration used in testing should be the same in production.
  * IaC provides an identical deployment
* Upgrades
  * Change a configuration with a single line of code
  * Modify configuration and software.
* Dynamic inventories
  * Query devices in real-time
  * Manage and make changes based on the results.
