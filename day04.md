# Network Communication

## Unicast
* One station sending information to another station. (One to one).
* Web surfing, file transfers
* Does not scale optimally for real-time streaming media
* IPv4 or IPv6.

## Multicast
* Delivery of information to interested systems (One to many of many).
* Multimedia, stock exchanges, dynamic routing updates.
* IPv4 or IPv6.

## Anycast
* Single destination IP address has multiple paths to two or more endpoints.
* Configure the same anycast address on different devices.
* Packets sent to an anycast address are delivered to the closest interface.

## Broadcast
* Send information to everyone at once.
* One packet, received by everyone.
* Routing updates, ARP requests.
* Not used in IPv6, use multicast instead.

## Wireless standards

### Wireless networking (802.11)
* Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEE 802).
* Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

## Wired standards

### Ethernet
* The most popular networking technology in the world.
* IEEE 802.3

### Optical Fiber
* Transmission by light.
* Types
    * Multimode fiber - short range communication. Inexpensive light source (LED)
    * Singlemode fiber - short range communication. Up to 100km without processing, using expensive laser light source.


### Cables
* Categories of cables grouped by data transfer rate. For example, CAT-6
* Coaxial cables have a common axis and two or more forms.
