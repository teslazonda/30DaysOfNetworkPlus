# Seven Second Subnetting

## Subnet masks and subnets

* `255.255.255.0` - 1 subnet (0-255)
* `255.255.255.128` - 2 subnets (0-127) (128-255)
* `255.255.255.192` - 4 subnets (0-63) (64-127) (128-191) (192-255)

Use tables to make quick subnet calculations, first converting from CIDR notation to decimal, acquiring the subnet mask, then calculating the first IP address and broadcast address from the decimal address.
