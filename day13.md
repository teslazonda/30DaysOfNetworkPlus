# Software Defined Networking

## SDN (Software Defined Networking)
* Networking devices have different functional places of operation.
  * Data, control, management planes
* Split the functions into separate logical units
  * Extend the functionality and management of a single device
  * Built for the cloud
* Infra layer/ Data plane
  * Process the network frames and packets
  * Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
* Control layer/ Control plane
  * Manages the actions of the data plane
  * Dynamic routing protocol updates
* Application layer / Management plane
  * Configure and manage the device
  * SSH, browser, API

## SD-WAN
* Software Defined Networking in a Wide Area Network
  * A WAN built for the cloud
* The data center used to be in one place
  * Cloud has changed things
* Cloud-based applications communicate directly to the cloud
  * No need to hop through a central point.

## SD-WAN characteristics
* Application aware
  * The WAN knows which app is in use.
  * Makes routing decisions based on the application data.

* Zero-touch provisioning
  * Remote equipment is automatically configured.
  * Application traffic uses the most optimal path.
  * Can change based on traffic patterns and network health.

* Transport agnostic
  * The underlying network can be any type.
  * DSL, fiber, 5G, etc.
  * Pick the best choice for the location.

* Central policy management
  * Management and configuration on a single console.
  * One device to configure
  * Changes are pushed to the SD-WAN routers.
