# Virtual Extensible LAN

## Data center interconnect(DCI)
* Connect multiple data centers together.
  * Seamlessly span across these geographic distances.
* Connect and segment different customer networks
  * Across multiple data centers.
  * All customers share the same core network.
* Distribute applications everywhere
  * Increase uptime and availability.
  * Workload can be moved to the best location.

## Scaling across data centers
* IP addressing is different across data centers.
  * Challenging to manage dynamically created virtual systems.
* Data centers can be connected in different ways
  * MPLS, high speed optical, etc.
* Extend networks across physical locations
  * Tunnel the data
  * Encapsulate, send data, decapsulate

## Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)
* Designed for large service providers
  * Hundreds or thousands of tenants
* VLANs
  * Maximum of about 4,000 possible virtual networks.
  * Fixed layer 2 domain
  * Not designed for large scale and dynamic movement of VMs.


* VXLAN support
  * Over 16 million possible virtual networks
  * Tunnel frames across a layer 3 network
  * Built to accomodate large virtual environments.
