# IPv4 Subnet Masks

## Classless subnetting
* CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
    * Created around 1993.
    * Removed restrictions created by classful subnet masks.
    * "Cider" block notation.
* Subnet masks can be expressed as decimal or in CIDR notation.
    * IP address, slash, number of subnet bits; `192.168.1.44/24`.
* You'll usually be provided an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.
    * Some operating systems are expecting decimal masks.
    * Some operating systems are expecting CIDR notation masks.

## The Subnet mask
* Contiguous series of ones.
    * Ones on the left
    * Zeros on the right
